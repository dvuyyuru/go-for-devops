IRS Chat BOT




Lets say we are hired from the IRS to answer questions w.r.t customer care. One of the hardes parts of the job is to only answer questions for the text for the IRS webpage. Lets take an example from below page. https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/business-taxes

If the user asks for "What are the types of business taxes". The answer should be 5. Lets build a bot to help answer these question.
